This paper examines the childcare strategies chosen by academician spouses in Adana. Labor market has increased the number of dual-earner families where both parents work at full-time positions. The focal point of the paper is to make a contribution to the literature on academic women's work and life balance in terms of childcare strategies and women's perception. This paper analyses spouses' childcare responsibility distributions and how their childcare strategies are influenced by gender roles even when all participants were academic spouses whose educational attainment are relatively higher than the societal average.   <br />

INTRODUCTION</span>
    <br />
    <br />

The male breadwinner/ female housewife model is declining across the world today. Development of industrial society brought women to labor markets thus growing numbers of working women exist in society. But the role of women has not been changed in parallel to this and women are expected to balance work and marital/parental roles without transferring responsibilities to men.  A large number of studies have been devoted to subject of work-family balance issues (Cohen, 2002; Goode, 1960; Greenhaus and Powell, 2006; Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985; Kanter, 1977; Kossek and Lambert 2005; Pitt-Catsouphes, Kossek and Sweet, 2006) concerning gender since 1950's. Some of those studies have been centered on women and their new/changing roles in society. Work and personal life balance is a term that refers to an individual's perceptions of the degree to which a person is experiencing positive relationships between different kind of roles such as work and family where the relationships are viewed as compatible and at equilibrium with each other (Kossek and Ozeki, 1998).   

<br />
    <br />
    Most contemporary research on dual-earner families tends to involve examining gender roles (Larsen, 2004). Wok-family balance has already been analyzed by profession by a number of researchers. Kanter (1977) was one of the first researchers who critiqued the prevailing assumption that workplaces and jobs must be designed to separate work from family demands. University staff have been studied by Fu and Shaffer in 2001,  concerning work-family balance. Previous studies indicated that there is strong relation between the gender roles and work-family balance. Given women's traditionally greater responsibility for care-giving, work-family conflict was found to affect life satisfaction to a greater degree for women than for men. 

<br /><br />According to Kossek et all (1999) the future directions of the work and family theory is moving from the notion of work and family balance to terms of growing acceptance of work and non-work life balance. Such terms suggest that many employees, even without dependents or visible forms of family related to care-giving can experience the need to seek work and family balance.  It also suggests as men become more involved in care-giving and domestic roles and women more involved in work and breadwinning roles, conflict and enrichment may more strongly relate to the role an individual is enacting (e.g., caregiver or breadwinner) than gender. Kossek's et all (1999) study has found that if there is no available relative for  care-giving for new comers of the family employee's more likely to devote their time to family rather than work. Indeed, this study has grounded on examining to childcare strategies of spouses which are indicated by Larsen (2004). According to Larsen's (2004) comprehensive study there are three common care strategies used by families.<br />
    <br />
    - Equal sharing<br />
    - Mother dominant<br />
    - Mother solo<br />
    <br />
    Three care patterns can be identified with respect to families "ways of coordinating their day-to-day care arrangements". First strategy is that parents share burden equally, they help each other by dividing care into specific chores or times. Second an alternative strategy is that mother dominant strategy when woman assumes most of the duties. Last strategy is called "mother solo" strategy which refers to male partner who hardly participates in the care chores, leaving childcare entirely to the mother. Windebank (2001) and Pfau-Effinger (1999) indicated that different factors impact care strategy of families such as, educational attainment of parents, provision of welfare services, the norms and traditions of society regarding gender roles, the age of children,   earnings and work scheduling.<br /><br />
Most researchers agree that work-life balance is impacted by norms and traditions of the society regarding gender roles, educational background and working schedule. The purpose of the current study is to examine the spouse's distribution of care burdens for children. Childcare is here defined as "assistance that provided in order to help children with the activities of their daily lives which can be provided as paid work by professionals or non-professional employment" (Larsen, 2004). Participants for this study were chosen among academic couples, and in terms of educational attainment, work load both husband and wife have similar characteristics except their gender role perception. Thus it is ensured that to examine only gender role distribution's impact on work-family balance of family. It is indicated that more egalitarian divisions can be traced in families where both parents have a high educational level, while a more traditional division of domestic labor can be seen among less educated couples by Crompton & Harris (1999) and Drobnic (2001). <br /><br />

Women assume more roles as societal conditions change fast. Today women equally share breadwinner role with men especially after baby's birth to support family budget although men are not likely to share care-giving role with women. However being parent requires to assume new responsibilities for each spouse. So it can be drawn from this point that as being parent women's family to work-conflict are increasing rather than men's (Kossek and Ozeki, 1998). Kossek and Ozeki (1998) studies indicated that the more the family role is brought into the job the more likely it increases family-to-work conflict, particularly for individuals who like to integrate work and family roles. Women are expected to be both caregiver and homemaker of the family by society. This gender role brings some more roles together such as finding right and available caregiver for the baby. <br /><br />
<span class="tatlimor">The Methodology and Sample </span><br />
    <br />

The main purpose of this paper is realized by the analyses of interviews with dual earner academician spouses. Spouse's child care responsibilities were used as the basic problem of the research. Three spouses were participated in interviews conducted among the public university academic staff. In this study academician spouses were chosen in order to prevent different in work loads of spouses. If spouse's professions were to be different then there would exist different work load for spouses and it may make some extra limitation to research.  
<br />
    <br />
Those three academic spouses who had accepted to participate in the study were interviewed to analyses their perception on childcare chores and it's effect on work-life balance of spouses.  Pre-structured interviews took 20 minutes. Spouses participated together to the interview to observe how they perceive each other's role and responsibility level in more natural atmosphere. The researcher provided a discussing atmosphere with the spouses to answer the research questions:
    <br />
    <br />
- Who is/was responsible for childcare responsibility during work hours? <br />
- Have both spouses' work-family balance been influenced by childcare duties equally? <br />
    <br />

Interviews were conducted in semi-structured manner and participants allowed to express their views comfortably.  Both spouses were reassured that all information gathered for study will be kept secretly. In the interviews, couples are invited to share their personal experience concerning work and family balance. Both interviews were arranged by ensuring participant's time convenience.  <br /><br />

<span class="tatlimor">Findings </span><br /><br />

As a management topic work and family balance is not new. There have been a lot of studies concerning the topic from a number of perspectives. But interviewing spouses at the same time is quiet rare and exciting phenomenon. The expected benefits of this research would be to contribute to the existing literature by expanding the work-family balance issues concerning childcare role. Below it is aimed to examine gender role affect on work-family balance of academician spouse in terms of care giving.
<br /><br />
As seen in the Table 1 all participant of the study have doctoral degrees. Their titles are mostly associate professor, except the first interviewee's female spouse who's position is teaching assistant. The first two couple had only one child, while third couple had 2 children one is 4 months and old one is 5 years old. 
<br />
    <br />
    Table 1: Some Characteristics of participants<br />
    <asp:Image ID="Image1" runat="server" ImageUrl="~/images/yazilar_img/kasim2008/Table1.jpg" /><br />
    <br />
To understand marginal effect of perception of gender role distribution on work-family balance, participants of the study were chosen from same profession with a high level of education. They were all working in the public university and had similar working conditions. By choosing same profession participants, the affect of work load was eliminated in assessing the work family balance of couples
<br />
    <br /><span class="tatlimor">
First Research Question:</span>The first question of this study was "who is/was responsible for childcare responsibility during work hours?". All three spouses accepted together that women dominant strategy was used. During the interview all women accepted that even if their husband tried to involve in finding or choosing process of the childcare person, they would not feel comfortable. 
<br />
    <br />
All women in the interviews agreed that men were not capable of childcare chores. This result was consistent with the Windebank's (2001) study results. Windebank (2001) argues that some women prevent their husband from participating in the nurturing, because they do not believe the father is capable of taking care of the child. 
<br />
    <br />
Thus the first question of the interview which was for understand care strategies of family, came out to be as "mother dominant" strategy. During the interviews women felt definitely comfortable with the result and there were not any complaint with the situation. This result can be related to role distributions of society. But only second female interviewee indicated that their children (5 years old) complain about this situation. Three couples, accept that baby's expenditures are equally afforded thus women were not left alone with the cost of raising children.
<br />
    <br />
Second Research Question: Second question of the interview was "Have both spouses' work-family balance been effected by childcare duties or not?" Indeed by this question researcher aimed to understand participant's work-family balance situation after parental responsibilities occurred. First two couple accepted together that, women have experienced evidently family to work conflict due to care giving roles. Those husbands accepted that their work-life balances were not affected in the same manner as women'. In a contrary, men emphasized that their work-life balance effected positively due to baby and responsibilities. They indicated that first two years of baby women were "naturally, engaged with baby, which leave them more freely during the night and day time. Their explanations were extended to gender role and discriminatory perceptions against women. Surprisingly at times women were in agreement with them that "care giving is only mother role". 
<br />
    <br />
Third couple was different than the first couples in terms of work-family balance views. Spouse together indicated that their work-family balances were influenced negatively due to baby sitting and care giving roles. They experienced family to work conflict after baby even though their care strategies was mother dominant strategy.,

<br />
    <br /><span class="tatlimor">
Discussion</span>
<br />
Families from same level of work tend to employ the same kind of care strategies in work-life balance issue. Similarly in this study, participants as academics they use mother dominant strategies. This situation can be extended to gender role distribution of society which is more influential than personal characteristics of those three couples. 
<br />
    <br />
Overall, interviews clearly indicated that women dominant care strategy is the main strategy used by families even if their educational attainment is very high. Considering their high educational attainment, their care strategy is not consistent with the Crompton & Harris (1999) and Drobnic (2001) and Larsen (2004) study results. According to theoretical findings academician spouses expected to use equal sharing strategies whereas in interviews couples indicated that they use mother dominant strategy. To being academic is not enough to breakthrough the society's gender role distribution. 
<br />
    <br />
Existing work-life balance literature scarcely and only indirectly refers to the structure of care arrangements. In this context childcare is often accepted in the household chores rather than as a separate activity (Cohen, 1993; Sundström and Duvander, 1999; Larsen, 2004). 
<br />
    <br />
In this study, the marginal influence of the childcare activities on the work-family balance was questioned during the interviews. As a result, especially, women indicated that their work and family balance were influenced negatively by childcare chores. Two couples indicated that female's work-life balance affected negatively by childcare while men's affected positively due to women engaged with childcare chores. Only one couple emphasized that their work-life balance affected equally due to childcare. That couple differ from others in terms of number of children. They have 2 children one is 4 months old and other is 5 years old. So it is logical to consider the number of children to understand work-life balance of the family. Theoretically it is expected that women's work-life balance is more fragile than men's (Larsen, 2004) due to gender role distribution of society despite spouses' high educational attainment. 
<br />
    <br /><span class="tatlimor">
Limitations and Implications for Future Research<br /></span>
    <br />

The main limitation of this study is sample size. Because of convenience considerations, sample size was kept to be limited with only 3 spouses. Indeed, it would have been very explanatory if large number of couples were involved in group discussion. Therefore this study suffered from both coverage and measurement errors.
<br />
    <br />
To conduct a study with different professions would provide meaningful contribution to the literature. Another limitation is methodology of the study. Accepting participants together have it's own pros and cons. So it would be meaningfull to check the study results with only one participant included interviews to eliminate the spouse's pressure on each others in the interviews.
