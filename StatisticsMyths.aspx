<span  class="siyahyazibuyuk">Bir araþtýrma kitabýnýn yorumu. Ýstatistikler sanýrým kitapta. Bu yazýda genel düþüncelere ve çýkarýlan sonuçlara yer verilmiþ. Bu sefer kadýnlarla erkeklerin eþit olduðu bir bölgeye bakalým. Neden eþitler? Özetle istatistiklere göre politika ve devlete baðlý olmayan sektörlerde çalýþan finli kadýnlarýn sayýsý erkeklerin düzeyine eriþmiþ. Bunun sebebi olarak kadýnlara yönetimde seçme ve seçilme hakkýný Avrupa'da en önce finli kadýnalr edinmiþ. Ayrýca okul öncesi çocuklara devlet gündüz bakýmý saðlamýþ. Ayrýca kadýnlara karþý yapýlan geleneksel yanlýþlarýn düzeltilmesiyle uðraþan yeni bir kadýn kuruluþu oluþturulmuþ. Bu kuruluþ da faaliyetlerini hep içeriden gerçekleþtirmiþ. Bir de örnek verilmiþ: Ýtalya'da kadýn kuruluþlarý sosyal karar verme mekanizmalarýndan ayrý olarak çalýþýyorlarmýþ fakat kabineye seslerini duyuramýyorlarmýþ. Tüm bunlara raðmen kadýnlar ayný pozisyondaki erkeklere göre daha düþük maaþ alýyorlarmýþ. Fakat eðitim kadýnlar için de çok önemliymiþ ve kadýnlara bakýþ açýsý "iþten çýkýnca koþa koþa eve gidip de çocuðuna, evine bakacak" deðilmiþ. Kadýnlar kendilerini eve kapatmýyor gerekli eðitimleri alýp yarý zamanlý ve ya tam zamanlý iþlerde çalýþýyorlarmýþ. Yazar, kadýnlarýn ilk meclise girdiði yýl (1906) meclisin %10 unun kadýn olduðunu ve bu sayede kadýnlarýn sosyal karar verme mekanizmasýna girerek kendi haklarýný elde edebildiklerini düþünüyor.

   <span class="baslik2"> Statistics and Myths</span> 
    <br />
    by <span class= "pembebuyukbaslik"> Maria Seppälä </span><br />

    If we are to believe the statistics, women in the Nordic countries are equal to
    men. Nordic women have full-time jobs, they look after the children and the home,
    and even take part in politics. But what has it taken for the Nordic woman to gradually
    enter the working life of her country, and by that token, its social and political
    discourse? The book The Finnish Woman, edited by the wife of the Finnish Premier,
    history teacher Päivi Lipponen, and Docent Päivi Setälä from the University of Helsinki´s
    Department of History, has approached its subject from the angles of feminist history,
    cultural politics and folklore as well as labour culture. The book was published
    this autumn in Finnish and English. 
    <br />
    <br />
    "Foreigners often ask us how we Nordic women
    with families manage to work full-time. Our answer is that it is made possible by
    school lunches and the statutory right to day care." This quotation is from the
    preface of the book The Finnish Woman. According to Setälä, they did not set out
    to create a mythical image of the Finnish woman, but to relate and analyse those
    issues that have led to the improvement of female status and to legal equality in
    Finland. They also wanted to show how in Finland, unlike in other countries, tenacious
    hard work towards equality in both the Parliament and the non-governmental organisations
    has yielded good results. Since Finland´s presidency has now turned the eyes of
    the other European Union countries towards her, Setälä and Lipponen found it especially
    important to seize the moment and promote Finnish feminist research. 
    <br />
    <br />
    The role of
    the state in the Nordic countries is very different to that in many other European
    Union countries. Even the concept of a Nordic welfare state is different from its
    equivalent in the Catholic world. The Nordic model is based on the individualism
    of the citizen.<span style="background-color: gainsboro"> For example, there is no family taxation in Finland - women work
    outside the home just as the men do, and are not financially dependent on their
    husbands. One of the achievements of the Finnish welfare state is the statutory
    right to day care. It places local governments under an obligation to provide full-time
    day care for all children under school age. In Finland, children begin school at
    the age of seven, or a year earlier if the parents so wish. The legislation has
    thus played a significant part in enabling mothers to work full-time.

    </span><span class="pembebuyukbaslik">Still not
    equal </span>
    <br />
    <br />
    Despite the fact that men and women are still not socially fully equal, they
    have always worked side by side in Finland. Political parties and labour union organisations
    have traditionally had their own women´s organisations, working alongside the men
    towards correcting social wrongs . The birth of a separate feminist culture is relatively
    new. Only the so-called radical feminist movement created a demand for the development
    of activities exclusively for women, and started emphasising the respective special
    gender characteristics. "The more radical feminist trend has to do with the general
    wave of social and political consciousness which started in the 1960s. Women have
    often been part of the birth of new social movements, although the history books
    keep quiet about them later, " says Setälä, who herself has encountered the masculinity
    of written history while doing research on women of antiquity. Although it has been
    a question of emancipation, the women´s groups have not acted outside society, but
    rather tried to change it from within. "The fact that women have had a voice in
    Finland is based on their presence in all of the social forums. In the traditional
    agricultural society, the women were strongly present, as they still are today,
    as influential members of both political and non-governmental organisations," Setälä
    says, and continues: "For example in Italy, where I lived for several years, women´s
    organisations act outside the social decision-making process. Their voice does not
    reach the cabinets." 
    <br />
    <br /><span class="pembebuyukbaslik">
    Equality has its roots in tradition </span>
    <br />
    <br />
    sIn agrarian Finland, the
    woman of the house looked after the farmstead and the children while the men worked
    the fields or did timber work. The division of work was not always, however, so
    clear-cut. The poor agrarian country needed the labour input of both women and children,
    including for physically demanding work. And today, despite the fact that she works
    full-time, the woman usually ends up being in charge of the household work and child-rearing.
    "Still, female labour has always been under-estimated," Setälä says. Even though
    their status has been secured in law, the female-dominated professions are generally
    lower-paid, and socially undervalued. A man draws a bigger salary than his equally-qualified
    female colleague for doing the same job. On the other hand, the previously-mentioned
    legislation has underlined the importance of women´s education and labour. In the
    Nordic countries, women are not tied to their homes. This also has to do with the
    idea of individualism. "Nobody assumes that the elderly are looked after at home,
    or that the women rush home to feed their children in the middle of the day," says
    Setälä, underlining the difference between Finland and southern Europe. "Women have
    been involved in politics in Finland for so long that their long history in this
    area makes it easy to include the question of equality in all decision-making,"
    Setälä explains. Finnish women were the first in Europe to be granted the vote,
    in 1906, and of the first elected parliament, ten per cent were women. "Although
    women, once they enter politics, mostly concentrate on the traditional women´s issues
    - the welfare of mothers and children, and domestic issues - one has to bear in
    mind that in recent years Finland has seen women in positions such as the Minister
    of Finance, and Minister for Defence," Setälä reflects. "Soon, gender discrimination
    in the labour market and in politics will be history. There simply aren´t such people
    in decisive positions any longer who would consider issues of equality as insignificant.
    That would be political suicide. That´s how politically incorrect it is," Setälä
    sums up. But there is a counter-argument to her opinion, and it too is represented
    in their book. According to that argument, the Finnish social and political situation
    could best be described with the term Ågender consensus´. Gender consensus contains
    the idea that issues of equality are not discussed in the open, because true equality
    has already been achieved in Finland. Therefore, feminism and equality work are
    often branded as fanaticism, which is considered both embarrassing and slightly
    ridiculous at the same time.
